    "# Winning Jeopardy\n",
    "*Jeopardy!* is a long-running game show where participants answer questions to win money. If you want to compete on Jeopardy, and you're looking for any competitive edge to help you win, then you should work with a dataset of *Jeopardy!* questions to figure out some patterns in the questions that could help you win. This is exactly what one *Jeopardy!* winner did, [here](https://vimeo.com/29001512) is a video of him breaking down his strategy.\n",

    "## The Dataset\n",
    "The dataset is named `jeopardy.csv`, and contains 20000 rows from the beginning of a full dataset of Jeopardy questions, which you can download [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/1uyd0t/200000_jeopardy_questions_in_a_json_file).\n",
